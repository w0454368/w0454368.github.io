									<h1><u>Java Project</u><br /></h1>
									<h2>Block & Key<br />
									2D-Platformer Game</h2>
									<p>This project was a larger assignment involving project management where it was 
										important to maintain proper documentation throughout the development of the program.
										I'm pretty proud of what I've done anyway though as I coded the game in almost pure raw Java. 
										I ended up using the Lightweight Java Game Library for rendering .png files to the screen, but 
										all of the actual game logic uses just normal Java code with a tiny bit of multithreading.
									</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="java/game/level1.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Level 1 of the game. No pits or spikes and only two enemies to try an acclimate the player 
									to the controls of the game in a non-punishing way.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="java/game/level2.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Level 2 of the game. Introduces spikes that kill the player instantly on contact.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="java/game/level3.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Level 3 of the game. I attempt to more fully utilize the space for this level and 
									encourage more precise jump inputs by the player to avoid taking damage.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="java/game/level4.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Level 4 of the game. A more advanced version of level 2, with spikes but also several bat enemies 
									and forcing the player to use either the improved jump height or speed from one of the two 
									powerup items in order to reach the key. 
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="java/game/level5.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Level 5 of the game. A final gauntlet of precise jump challenges to get through to the end without dying. 
									The game closes upon completion of this level.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="java/game/collision1.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The first bit of multithreading I came up with for this project. The JumpLimiter Java class has two 
									primary purposes. First, It uses java's TimerTask implementation to place a delay between toggling 
									a boolean value to determine whether a "jump" input by the player actually causes the player to jump or 
									not. This prevents the player from "flying" by jumping repeatedly. The second purpose is increasing the 
									players height in small but rapid increments and checking with each iteration against a different boolean value 
									to see if the player has collided with a block and breaking out of the jump loop if this value is true. This prevents 
									the player from jumping through blocks. 
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="java/game/collision2.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My detectBlockCollision() method initializes a boolean value as false, then checks player positioning against an arraylist 
									of all the block positions in the current level. If the player is within or against the bounds of any of the blocks the boolean 
									is toggled to true and if the player is clipping into the block they are shifted to the left or right of the block depending on which 
									side of the block they're closer to. Finally, after checking against every block in the list the boolean value is returned so it can 
									be used for other game logic such as the previous JumpLimiter example.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="java/game/damage2.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Here's a snippet of handling for damage collision with enemies. Enemy types are stored in an enumeration and since the spike 
									obstacles are technically treated as an enemy this code differentiates between collision with a spike and collision with any other 
									enemy. Spikes simply lower player health by 3 which is enough to instantly defeat the player and push them back to the start of the 
									current level. For other enemies it lowers player health by 1 and instantiates InvulnTime and DamageFlicker objects to handle player 
									invulnerability time between the player taking damage and the player sprite flickering in response to that damage respectively.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="java/game/damage3.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Here you can see the simple logic involved with the invulnerability period between being able to take 
									damage. Upon generation of an object of this class in response to taking damage, a boolean value for 
									determining if the player should be able to take damage is checked and if true is toggled to false then a 
									TimeTask starts to wait one second before toggling the flag back to true. 
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="java/game/damage4.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The DamageFlicker class works similarly to the previous InvulnTime class, but it uses a repeating scheduled task 
									to rapidly toggle a boolean that alters the sprite for the player to create a flickering visual effect to indicate to 
									the player that they have received damage. The final short sleep and boolean setting call is a failsafe to ensure that 
									after the while loop ends the player's sprite is set back to the "not damaged" state.
